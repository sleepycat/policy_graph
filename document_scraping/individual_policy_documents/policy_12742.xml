Context"><p>3.1 Information is an essential component of effective management across departments. The availability of high-quality, authoritative information to decision makers supports the delivery of programs and services, thus enabling departments to be more responsive and accountable to Canadians. </p><p>Managing information and records using a whole-of-government approach where legislation permits, supports managers' ability to transform organizations, programs and services in response to the evolving needs of Canadians. While information management encompasses records, as well as documents, data, library services, information architecture, etc., records and their management are mentioned at key points in the policy for the purpose of emphasis. Integrating information management considerations 
into all aspects of government business enables information to be used and recognized as a valuable asset. All these activities are indicative of a culture that values information.</p><p>Information is managed to meet requirements for the government as a whole, including official languages legislation and policies, what information is used, how it is organized, described, etc., as well as the specific requirements determined by departmental operational needs and accountabilities. As the Government of Canada increasingly uses information technologies to implement these requirements, integrating information management requirements with technology planning ensures that digital information 
is accessible, shareable, and usable over time and through technological change. </p><p>All employees are responsible for applying information management principles, standards, and practices as expressed in Treasury Board and departmental frameworks, policies, directives, and guidelines in the performance of their duties, and for documenting their activities and decisions. Expert services such as records, library, and data management provide specialized information management support to departments. </p><p>3.2 The deputy head is responsible for effective and well co‑ordinated information management throughout his or her department. </p><p>3.3 This policy is issued under the authority of section 7 of the FAA. </p><p>3.4 The Treasury Board has delegated to the Secretary of the Treasury Board the authority to issue, amend, and rescind directives and standards concerning information management roles and responsibilities, and recordkeeping to support this policy. </p><p>3.5 This policy is to be read in conjunction with the <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12452"><em>Policy Framework for Information and Technology</em></a>, and supporting directives and standards </p><p>3.6 Additional mandatory requirements are set out in the directives and standards listed in <a href="#appB">Appendix B</a>. </p></chapter><chapter anchor="4" title="4.
