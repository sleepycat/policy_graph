the <em><a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/P-21/">Privacy Act.</a></em></p></chapter><chapter anchor="3" title="3. Context"><p>3.1 Under the <em><a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/P-21/">Privacy Act</a></em>,
individuals have the right to access their personal information and the right
to request correction or have a notation added to any recorded personal
information that is under the control of a government institution. This also
includes the assurance that other individuals or organizations that use the
information for an administrative purpose are informed of the correction or
notation. Individuals have a right to know what personal information government
institutions collect and to ensure that such information is accurate and
complete. The right to access and the right to request correction may be
limited under certain conditions. The <em><a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/P-21/">Privacy Act</a></em>
establishes that heads of government institutions are responsible for
responding to requests for access to personal information and for its
correction.</p><p>3.2 The <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12510"><em>Policy on Privacy
Protection</em></a> establishes that heads (or their delegates) are responsible
for ensuring that the <em><a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/P-21/">Privacy
Act</a></em> and the <em><a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-83-508/index.html">Privacy
Regulations</a></em> are administered through consistent practices and
procedures and that requests for access to personal information are met with
timely, complete and accurate responses. Those responsibilities involve
validating the identity of the requester and protecting that identity to the
extent possible, developing procedures to process the requests, providing
access to personal information and exercising discretion. Heads (or their
delegates) are also responsible for any request for correction of personal
information and for ensuring that it is processed in accordance with the <em><a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-83-508/index.html">Privacy Regulations</a></em>. Government institutions
promote the principles of openness and transparency by facilitating informal
access to personal information wherever feasible and by respecting both the
spirit and requirements of the <em><a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/P-21/">Privacy Act</a>, <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-83-508/index.html">Privacy Regulations</a></em> and related policy
