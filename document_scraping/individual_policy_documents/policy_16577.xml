Effective date"><p>1.1 This directive takes effect on July 1, 2009.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="2" title="2. Application"><p>2.1 This directive applies to:</p><ul><li>All departments within the meaning of Schedules I, I.1, II, IV and V of the <em>Financial Administration Act</em> (FAA),unless excluded by specific acts, regulations or Orders in Council;
    and</li><li>Only those departments using the Public Works and Government Services Canada (PWGSC) pay system for responsibilities outlined in Section 6.2.</li></ul></chapter><chapter anchor="3" title="3. Context"><p>3.1 Identity management is the determination by a government institution that the identity of an individual or institution with whom it is transacting is legitimate. Identity management is at
  the heart of the public administration and most government business processes. Once an identity is established, all subsequent government activities, ranging from safeguarding assets to delivering
  services, benefits and entitlements to responding to disasters and emergencies, rely upon this identity.</p><p>3.2 Different identity management practices across the Government of Canada (GC) and other jurisdictions may increase the risks of fraudulent use of identity documents, identity theft, improper
  granting of entitlements, benefits leakage, financial losses to individuals and governments, and invasion of privacy.</p><p>3.3 Without a coherent, consistent, standardized and interoperable approach for dealing with identity across the federal government and other jurisdictions, successful risk mitigation strategies
  are increasingly difficult to develop and deploy to manage challenges to national security, respect for privacy, program integrity and the delivery of citizen-centred services.</p><p>3.4 There is a clear need for a consistent approach to identity management that is supported by standards. This will ensure that security requirements are met and that services are developed,
  administered and delivered to the right clients. The development and implementation of this standardized approach will also permit a robust, scalable and flexible solution for the proper validation
  of identity information.</p><p>3.5 The responsibility for identity management must be fulfilled by departments when:</p><ul><li>Unique identification is required for the purposes of administering a federal program or service enabled by legislation;</li><li>Disclosure of identity is required before receiving a government service, participating in a government program or becoming a member of a government organization.</li></ul><p>3.6 This directive is issued pursuant to section 7 of the <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/F-11/">FAA</a>.</p><p>3.7 This directive is to be read in conjunction with the <em><a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=13616">Foundation Framework for Treasury Board Policies</a></em>the <em>Policy on Government
  Security,</em> and the <em>Directive on Departmental Security Management</em>.</p><p>3.8 Additional mandatory requirements are set out in standards supporting the following subject areas:</p><ul><li>Information and identity assurance</li><li>Personnel security screening</li><li>Physical security</li><li>Information technology security</li><li>Emergency and business continuity management</li><li>Security in contracting</li></ul></chapter><chapter anchor="4" title="4. Definitions"><p class="indent1">4.1 For definitions of terms used in this policy, refer to the Appendix–Definitions.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="5" title="5. Directive statement"><section anchor="5.1" title="5.1 Objective"><p>The objective of this directive is to ensure effective identity management practices by outlining requirements to support departments in the establishment, use and validation of identity.</p></section><section anchor="5.2" title="5.2 Expected results"><p>The expected results of this directive are:</p><div class="indent1"><p>5.2.1 Sound identity management practices that are aligned with an integrated government-wide approach to achieve effective identity management across the
GC;</p><p>5.2.2 Identity management is an identifiable and integral element of departmental programs, activities and services;</p><p>5.2.3 Effective identity management ensures that departmental service and security requirements are met and that departments are dealing with the right
client when delivering services; and</p><p>5.2.4 Departments ensure that their identity management activities allow for interoperability, when appropriate, which enables the exchange of
individuals' identity information to meet the overall objectives of the GC and the respective mandates of departments.</p></div></section></chapter><chapter anchor="6" title="6. Requirements"><p>6.1 Managers at all levels with responsibilities for identity management will manage identity in a manner that mitigates risks to personal, organizational and national security, protects program
integrity and enables well-managed, citizen-centred service delivery. Managers at all levels with this responsibility are responsible for:</p><div class="indent1"><p>6.1.1 Ensuring there is a rightful need for identification and the lawful authority to identify for a specific program or in support of law enforcement,
national security or defence activities;</p><p>6.1.2 Articulating identity management risks (e.g., change of circumstances, errors, malfeasance), program impacts, required levels of assurance and risk
mitigation options;</p><p>6.1.3 Selecting an appropriate set of identity data (such as personal attributes or identifiers) to sufficiently distinguish a unique identity to meet
program needs, which is proportionate to identified risks and flexible enough to allow for alternative methods of identification, when appropriate; and</p><p>6.1.4 Implementing identity information sharing solutions that adhere to common GC standards.</p></div><p>6.2 Human resources managers are responsible for:</p><div class="indent1"><p>6.2.1 Ensuring each federal public service employee is assigned a unique personal record identifier (PRI) for the management of employee-related
information and transactions; and</p><p>6.2.2 Ensuring each employee who must be identified to one or more remittance agencies outside the federal public service is assigned an individual agency
number (IAN).</p></div><p>6.3 Monitoring and reporting requirements</p><p>Within departments</p><p>Managers at all levels with responsibilities for identity management are responsible for:</p><ul><li>Monitoring adherence to this directive within their department and ensuring that appropriate remedial action is taken to address any departmental
