Effective date"><p>1.1 This policy takes effect on August 20, 2014.</p><p>1.2 It replaces the <em>Policy  on Privacy Protection</em> dated April 1, 2008.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="2" title="2. Application"><p>2.1 This policy applies to government institutions as defined in section 3 of the <em>Privacy Act</em> (the Act), including parent Crown corporations and any wholly owned subsidiary of these corporations. It does not apply to the Bank of Canada.</p><p>2.2 This policy does not apply to information excluded under the Act.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="3" title="3. Context"><p>3.1 Canadians value their privacy and the protection of their personal information. They expect government institutions to respect the spirit and requirements of the <em>Privacy Act</em>. The Government of Canada is committed to protecting the privacy of individuals with respect to the personal information that is under the control of government institutions. The government recognizes that this protection is an essential element in maintaining public trust in government.</p><p>3.2 The Supreme Court of Canada has characterized the Act as "quasi-constitutional" because of the role privacy plays in the preservation of a free and democratic society. Privacy protection in this sense means limiting government interventions into the private lives of Canadians to lawful and necessary purposes. It also means that government is to ensure a high standard of care for personal information under the control of government institutions. The government also has to respond 
to requests for access to personal information. Sound information management plays a key role in facilitating the exercise of access rights under the Act and ensuring privacy protection. </p><p>3.3 With the enactment of the <em>Federal Accountability Act</em>, the scope of the <em>Privacy Act</em> was broadened and now includes well over 200 government institutions. Under the <em>Privacy Act</em>, the Treasury Board President is the designated minister responsible for preparing policy instruments concerning the operation of the <em>Privacy Act</em> and its Regulations. The <em>Privacy Act</em> establishes that policy and guidelines are the appropriate vehicles for supporting its administration.</p><p>3.4 Heads of the government institutions are responsible for the effective, well-coordinated, and proactive management of the <em>Privacy Act</em> and <em>Privacy Regulations</em> within their institutions. </p><p>3.5 This policy is issued pursuant to paragraph 71(1)(d) of the Act. This policy also contains elements that relate to paragraphs 70(1)(b) and (e) of the Act.</p><p>3.6 This policy is to be read in conjunction with the <em><a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12452&amp;section=text">Policy Framework for Information and Technology</a></em>and the <em><a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12453">Policy on Access to Information</a>.</em></p><p>3.7 Additional mandatory privacy-related requirements are set out in the:</p><ul><li><em><a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12450">Privacy Impact Assessment Policy</a></em></li><li><em><a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=13342">Directive on the Social Insurance Number </a></em></li></ul><p>3.8 The President of the Treasury Board will issue specific directives and standards to support this policy regarding privacy impact assessments, the Social Insurance Number, administration of the <em>Privacy Act</em>, privacy practices, privacy management, annual reports to Parliament, creation and registration of personal information banks (PIBs) and statistical reporting.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="4" title="4.
